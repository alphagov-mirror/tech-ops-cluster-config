## Sandbox Cluster

The intension of the sandbox cluster is to provide a playground for all GDS users to experiment in a production grade environment for when gsp-local is not enough.

There are no availability guarentees for the sandbox. It will not be up at night. It may be running as yet unreleased components for early preview.
